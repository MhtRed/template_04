# Template_4

This is an Admin Dashboard designed using HTML & CSS without any framework or library.

## Technologies used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
  - my own framework (I 've build my own CSS framework as I was working on the project to take advantage of repeated CSS pattern used in this design)
  - flex box
  - CSS Grid
  - ...

## Screen sizes and breakpoints used:

- The design is almost responsive, and that was possible by the use of the grid system and the widgets model.
- To make it fully responsive, I used only two type of screens:
  - Mobile screens(sm): max-width: 767px
  - laptop screens (lg): min-width: 768px
